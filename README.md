# ECB based Economic Uncertainty Index

This is a running project where I am creating an index for economic uncertainty based on main ECB publications (statements, Q & As, and accounts). <br>

So far I have scraped the relevant texts, cleaned and merged them, and created a first very simple index, based on a small dictionary. Next up is expanding the dictionary, before I want to turn to a more advanced index applying FinBERT.
