# ECB based Economic Uncertainty Index

This is a running project where I am creating an index for economic uncertainty index based on main ECB publications (statements, Q & As, and accounts). <br>

So far I have scraped the relevant texts. Next up is data cleaning and a first simple dictionary approach, before I want to apply FinBERT.
